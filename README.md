## Hi there 👋

## About me

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to teach others and help them get started in development.

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with: finding an open-source project to give back to community!
- 💬 Ask me about: Starting a career in development, how to market yourself as a software developer, open source projects
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aggies2018/) is the best way.
